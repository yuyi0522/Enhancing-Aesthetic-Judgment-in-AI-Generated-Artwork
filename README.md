Integrating GPT and BERT for Artistic Prompt Refinement: Enhancing Aesthetic Judgment in AI-Generated Artwork
This research offering significant advancements in the fields of AI-generated art, prompt optimization, and educational technology. Firstly, the study demonstrates an innovative integration of GPT and BERT models to systematically enhance the quality of user-generated prompts, specifically within the domain of computer graphics. 

# Research question
1. How can the integration of GPT and BERT models be utilized to systematically enhance the aesthetic quality of user-generated prompts in the context of AI-generated artwork?
2. In what ways does refining prompts across dimensions such as composition, color, style, lighting, and character depiction impact the overall quality and sophistication of AI-generated art?
3. How effective is the proposed hybrid approach in improving prompt quality when applied to educational contexts, specifically within computer graphics courses, and what implications does this have for broader applications in creative disciplines?

The training process of a text classification model utilizing BERT. The process begins with the input of user-generated prompts, which undergo expert evaluation to generate quality labels. These prompts, now labeled with their respective quality assessments, serve as input for the BERT model. During the model training phase, BERT processes these inputs and the associated quality labels to learn patterns and features that distinguish high-quality prompts. The output of this training is a constructed classifier model that can automatically evaluate and classify new prompts based on the learned criteria. This approach integrates expert knowledge with advanced machine learning techniques to create a robust classification system for prompt quality assessment.
